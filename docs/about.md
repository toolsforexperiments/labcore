# About page

Labcore and the whole [Tools For Experiments](https://github.com/toolsforexperiments) are the sofware efforts of [Pfaff-lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pfaff.physics.illinois.edu/).

We are an experimental physics research group at UIUC, where we are a part of the Physics department, IQUIST and MRL. Our work falls broadly into quantum optics and quantum information, with a lot of influences from AMO and condensed matter physics.
