# About page

We are Pfafflab. (this is what github copilot thinks we are) We are a group of researchers at the University of Toronto. We are interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of the brain. We are particularly interested in the role of RNA-binding proteins in this process. We use a combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to study these proteins. We are also interested in developing new tools and technologies to study RNA-binding proteins. Our goal is to understand how RNA-binding proteins regulate gene expression in the brain and how they contribute to brain development and function.
